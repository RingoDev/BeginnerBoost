<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<p>I am currently working on my Dell XPS 13 hooked up to a monitor. It is running Windows 10 and has served me well until now.</p>
<p>To get access to a Linux Terminal, I installed VirtualBox and I am running POP!_OS on it. I am still using Google Chrome as my main graphical browser right now but that may change in the future.</p>
<p>I am only using a single monitor but i will probly get another one soon.</p>
