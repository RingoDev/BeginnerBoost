title: My Setup
---

I am currently working on my Dell XPS 13 hooked up to a monitor. It is running Windows 10 and has served me well until now.

To get access to a Linux Terminal, I installed VirtualBox and I am running POP!\_OS on it. I am still using Google Chrome as my main graphical browser right now but that may change in the future.

As of today (May, 12th) I am running POP!\_OS on the lenovo laptop i had laying around. I had to fiddle around a bit to find a working driver for the network card but now everything runs really smooth. I just love the clean feeling of [POP!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com)!
