## My setup

I am currently working on my Dell XPS 13 hooked up to a monitor. It is running Windows 10 and has served me well until now.

To get access to a Linux Terminal, I installed VirtualBox and I am running POP!\_OS on it. I am still using Google Chrome as my main graphical browser right now but that may change in the future.

I am only using a single monitor but i will probly get another one soon.
