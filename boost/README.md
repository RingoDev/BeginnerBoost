title: Linux Beginner Boost
---

I am taking part in a Linux focused course, which is led by [rwxRob](https://twitch.com/rwxrob) on Twitch. He is mentoring over a hundred people about basic Linux knowledge, how to become sufficient at using the terminal and many more necessary skills to become a capable Developer. The greatest thing about the course is that it is completely free and anyone can join.

For more information take a look at [rwx.gg](https://rwx.gg) or the [notes](/notes) I am taking every session to keep up with the flood of Information rob is providing us with.

This webpage exists purely due to the course and i will use it to document my experiences and improvements over time, so feel free to check in any time.
